# What is an MCP?

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that enables structured, context-aware automation and testing workflows. MCP integrates with tools like Playwright to provide a standardized way to define, execute, and manage automated tests and scenarios.

## Advantages of Using Playwright MCP for Automation
- **Unified Workflow:** MCP organizes test steps and scenarios, making automation more maintainable and scalable.
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Playwright MCP allows you to automate tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single codebase.
- **Rich Context:** MCP provides detailed context and history for each test, improving traceability and debugging.
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines and modern development tools.

## Security
Playwright MCP is designed with security in mind. It runs tests in isolated browser contexts, supports secure authentication flows, and can be integrated with enterprise-grade security policies. Sensitive data can be managed and protected using environment variables and secure storage.
